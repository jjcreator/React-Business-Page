## About

A website project created to reinforce and improve my React skills. Working on it has helped me understand how the React library handles in practice, what do I need to pay attention to and what are the main challenges and differences while using React vs vanilla Javascript. The website itself is a simple 3-page build, with 3 sections on the main page and one on each of the other pages. To make it more fun I've added vertical navigation and a few hi-res pictures.
